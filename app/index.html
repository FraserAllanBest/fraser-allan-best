        Finding a seat in the Sony Centre, the person next to me turns and makes a (mildly) off colour joke. I won’t repeat it, but I laughed. The two of us were there to see Bill Burr, a headline comic at JFL, known for his crassly provocative, and arguably misogynistic set.
        </p>
        <p>
        At least on the former, Burr did not disappoint. Fresh out of the gate, Burr riffed on the sexual transition of Caitlin Jenner. Pleading ignorance as he blazed through a dense forest of jokes sure to offend the sensibilities of any general audience, especially a Canadian one.
        </p>
        <p>
        But — for the most part — they didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
        Instead, the act offered a sort of catharsis. The more shocking parts of the show were reminiscent of a distant uncle on an offensive rant at a family reunion. But instead of having to nervously prod the potato salad, the audience was offered the release of laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
        Playing the role of a refreshingly uninhibited off-the-cuffer, Burr played with the audience's favor. Sensing the tension of the crowd after a rather cavalier mention of the Holocaust, Burr pivoted the show to settle on the topic. Committing, he compared the crimes of Hitler and Stalin with the achievements of various sports and music stars - risque to say the least.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is where Burr shines. Where other comedians would only dig themselves into a hole, Burr comes out on top. After he jilted the audience with Cards-Against-Humanity-style bombshells, Burr built on the tension that most comics would try to contain. By the end of each controversial segment, Burr opened the pop can he had just shaken. The audience’s tension released in choruses of laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
        But the show was not for everyone. For a sizable portion of the audience, Burr did not find redemption. A woman two seats down from me crossed her arms at the early mention of Caitlin Jenner. They uncrossed at the end of the show.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is understandable; and isn’t just a matter of the pert versus the puritanical. Burr’s performance was just as much about tone as it was about content. While Burr resonated with some, others may have preferred a different — but not necessarily “safer” — comic mood. The divide is not dissimilar to those who appreciate the humor of The Office, but find it's awkward tension unbearable.
        </p>
        <p>
        Between the two back-to-back acts he performed at JFL42, Burr recycled almost none of his material. Beyond being a pleasure for repeat audience members, this captured an important quality in Burr’s style. Through the act, a careful viewer could notice Burr stepping out of prepared segments, and riffing on a topic to gauge the mood, before deciding where to go next.
        </p>
        <p>
        While this is a talent of Burr’s, at JFL42 it was a liability For many comedians, the comedy festival is a place to showcase their most carefully compiled material, presenting a thematic arc, or punchy cohesive statement. Burr’s choose-your-own-adventure style stunted this possibility, leaving the audience with a string of disjoint — albeit entertaining — segments on topics ranging from overpopulation, to oral sex.
        </p>
        <p>
        Over the course of two sets, Burr settled into a rhythm, more comfortably riffing towards the end of the night. Judging the act on the eagerness of the ovation, a looser, more digression-prone, Burr was better received. While the crowd rose after both sets (conforming to a regrettable standard), the second ovation was unreluctant, and immediate.
        </p>
        <p>
        But maybe the ovation was simply reflexive. Having abandoned any semblance structure or arc by the end of the second set, the ending felt rather sudden.
        </p>
        <p>
        As the crowd exited the Sony Centre and started to whisper about the next comic at JFL42, I wondered if Burr's performance would stand out as memorable one.
